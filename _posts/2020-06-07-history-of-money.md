In order to understand the role of blockchain in finance and how it may fit within the modern world, it helps to first look at what money is and the history of it. What have humans used as money in the past? How have these forms of money transformed into our conceptions of money now? What makes money valuable? What is moral and immoral about how we operate economically today and why is it the way it is? What is a financial system really? How is bitcoin money? How can blockchain innovate on what we currently know of as money?

### A History of Money
Below is a list of key events that happened throughout the [history of money](https://www.hostmerchantservices.com/articles/financial-news-articles/the-history-of-currency-from-bartering-to-the-credit-card/)

**The Stone Ages and Non-Metal Money**
- Starting from about 5,000 B.C. subsistence agriculture was the heart of the economy for civilations in the region of [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Economy_and_agriculture). 
- Early accounting was used to track who owned what amount of which crop. Communities would put their crops in a shared storage. 
- Sumerian Temples functions as the first banks, storing some of the earliest forms of ledgers.  ["Cuneiform"](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485) tablets were used to track the movement of assets. [Correspondence counting](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485) was used to track inventory for each asset.
- Primitive forms of contracts took shape using an intelligent invention called ["Bulla"](http://www.projectglobalawakening.com/bullae-ancient-accounting/). These were hollow clay balls that were inscribed in such a way to enable the signing of transactions and create tamper-proof agreements.
- Earliest forms of money were livestock, salt, peppercorns, tea, cowrie shells, [yap stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones)
- Starting around 1754 BC, the [Code of Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi) is created as the first way to enforce laws, with half of the codes being based around enforcing economic contracts

**The Iron Age, Rome, Medieval Ages and Metal Money**
- Gold, silver and bronze used for private and public trade. Before coins, these metals needed to be weighed and verified in order to determine their value. 
- The [first use of coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia#First_coinage) made of electrum were adopted in 700BC. The standardized weights of coins simplified trade. The original coins were unmarked.
- Lydian coins [evolved to be stamped with an emblem](https://donaldscarinci.com/lydian-striated-stater/). The first case of tying a coin to a ruling authority, enabling them to be more easily accepted by those members within the state during trade. Other kingdoms decided to follow suite and the era of stamped coins began.
- 
- In the beginning, civilization used [single entry systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-entry_bookkeeping) to record transactions
- The [double entry ledger](https://medium.com/unraveling-the-ouroboros/a-brief-history-of-ledgers-b6ab84a7ff41) is created in 1340 AD. Every entry is entered twice, once as a credit once as a debit. This way of record keeping was the foundation for thinking from a capitalist paradigm.

History Of Money: 
Started with salt and other objects
eventually scarce metals
then paper money


paper money - easier to handle

commodoties trading - get a piece of paper saying I have this "thing" in a warehouse. 








With blockchain - now we can record the same commodity verification like paper money but instead hold the private key verifying we own the record in the ledger (confirm this theory)


types of ledgers - 
Transaction (bitcoin) vs balance (ethereum)

General ledger vs Subledger
Central bank is like a general ledger for money
All the other commercial banks are like the subledger for money. These commercial banks are part of the feds general ledger

Double entry ledger:
The heart of capitalism in a sense is double entry bookkeeping. 
It helped europe come out of the dark ages. 
These ledgers are balances of assets and liabilities. When assets exceed liabilities, thats our capital.

Characteristics of good ledgers:
- its immutable
- its timestamped
- Ownership (know the parties involved in each transaction)
- Its accurate

Payment Systems: 
- A method to amend and record changes in a ledger using money

Deposits & negotiable orders: 
This is a check 
Important pieces of this document: a signature, a payee (this ledger its going to), how much, what it was for, has account number and routing number (the ledger its coming from)

Early LEdgers: Tally sticks, Yap stone

Fiat Currency: 
- has social and economic consensus
- Represents central bank liabilities (fiat is the liability side of the central bank)
- Relies on system of ledgers integrated into a fractional banking system
- Accepted for taxes
- Notes & coins are legal tender for all debts public and private
- has unique tax treatment


More on Fiat and how it works: 
- we have gone on and off the gold standard. Fell off of it after WWI then went back on it etc... went on and off

- in the US there are about 9k commercial banks, the fed is the entral bank.
- A dollar says "Federal reserve note". We used to be able to replace these notes for equivalent of gold and silver. Bank used to be liable for giving back gold for the dollar.
- As a matter of accounting in double entry bookkeeping the dollar is on the liability side
- A central bank is liable for the dollar insofar as we move that dollar to a commercial bank. That movement 
- Its a liability in the sense of, if you bring your paper money in, we will record it on the ledger of a commercial bank and it can be used to pay taxes to the government.
- The central bank has the dollar as a liability in the sense that is works to ensure the stability of this social thing we call money. 

Students Answer: 
-Its a liability for central bank because if governmetn has soveirgn debt, it cant just issue new notes. Its a liability because you can only issue notes over a certain amount of reserves that you keep. cant just issue notes whenever they are needed:

- One interesting questions: How do you make two closed payment systems (different countries) interoperable


Credit Cards: 
They started off grassroots by entrepreneurs and businesses as charge cards. 

Credit cards started around 1950, regulations on credit cards didnt really start until the 1970's. People say why cant we regulate bitcoin now? Well when we introduced credit cards it took around 15-20 years to actually regulate it. 

Bitcoin entrepreneurs today have time due to loose regulation and the amount of time it takes to truly regulate. 


Characteristics of Money:
- Durable 
- Portable
- Divisible
- Uniform/Fungible
- Acceptable
- Stable

Design of Money:
- Token vs Account Based
- Physical vs Digital
- Private vs Central bank


Why previous digital cash attempts failed:
- Merchant Adoption
- Centralization
- Double spending
- consensus


A big question about defining mobile money:
- Where is the store of value? Are they storing the value or processing it? (m-pesa stored it, google pay processes it)

How to move money peer to peer without a central authority: The answer to this is Satoshi's paper.


How to we notarize information digitally? With hash functions. A company solved this in 1995.
