Today I decided to join an MIT Open Courseware course titled [Blockchain and Money](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/lecture-slides/). I decided to join it in order to get informed on what role Blockchain technology has to play in the financial sector. I am optimistic that this technology will shake up the financial industry in the years to come and I want to understand where the best places may be to put my focus on as a software engineer. 

The professor guiding this course is [Gary Gensler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gensler), the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and current Senior Advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. During his time in the CFTC, he oversaw the reform of a $400 trillion dollar market while serving Obama. What a great authority in the world of finance to learn from and for free!

While progessing through this course I will be sharing what I learn on this blog. I'm doing this for a few reasons. First and foremost my aim is to solidify and deepen my understanding of the material in this course. I want to know what potential Blockchain has in the financial industry and what opportunities I may be able to capitalize on over the next few years. 
While doing this, I hope to find others who will join me on this journey.

Along the way I will write content that may be of value to others also interested in this subject matter as I train my brain to think critically about questions related to Blockchain in the finance industry. Some of the questions I'm interested in exploring include:
- How can one discern what ideas around blockchain tech have disruptive market potential. Or as Peter Thiel puts it, what ideas can propel somebody from [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)?
- What problems does this technology solve and how?
- In what ways could this technology disrupt financial institutions and governments?
- What roles do governments have to play in the evolution of this technology?
- What will allow this technology to scale?
- How can we solve the problems of interoperability?
- What are the barriers to adoption and what can be done to overcome them?

As I dive down this rabbit hole, I am sure I will discover a domain of fascinating questions to ask that I have not yet thought of. 

Looking forward to this journey and to cultivating a sense of direction and purpose somewhere within the vast space of potential opportunities that exist with blockchain technology and finance and hope that over time it may be of value for others to learn from!
